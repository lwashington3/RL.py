# Rocket League Data Scraper

# Update on July 9, 2023.
I finally figured out why TRN does not provide a Rocket League API and will be taking this project down as to not go against their wishes. If you have cloned this repository, I urge you to delete it. This message is stating that I __do not__ condone scraping data off their website without their permission.

# Update on July 11, 2023.
If you have a version of the project released before 2.0.0, I urge you to delete it and update to 2.0.0 or above. Tracker Network (TRN) was the original source of data, however they have requested users stop scraping their website. All foreseeable updates will use [RLStats](https://rlstats.net). I __do not__ condone scraping data off the TRN website without their permission, and this project will be removed if [RLStats](https://rlstats.net) asks for it to be shut down.
